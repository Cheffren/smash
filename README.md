# Connection with Database
- You can find the database connection in config/config.ini
- Whenever a connection is required, use: `$conn = Db::getInstance();`

# Before you start coding:
- Always pull before write your own code, so you're always up to date
- Keep master branch intact, every feature should be made on a different branch
- Only merge branch when it works
- When contributing, follow standard commit conventions

# Example of a git commit message
`git commit -m "Feat: add margin to list items to prevent them from overlapping"`
